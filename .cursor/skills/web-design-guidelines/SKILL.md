# Web Interface Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Web Interface Guidelines.

## How It Works

1. Read the guidelines from `#[[file:references/guideline.md]]`
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the guidelines
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Reference

All rules and output format instructions are in:

```
#[[file:references/guideline.md]]
```

The guidelines cover:

- Accessibility (ARIA, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation)
- Focus states and keyboard interaction
- Forms (autocomplete, validation, labels)
- Animation (reduced motion, performance)
- Typography (proper characters, number formatting)
- Content handling (overflow, empty states)
- Images (dimensions, lazy loading)
- Performance (virtualization, DOM reads)
- Navigation & state (URL sync, deep linking)
- Touch & interaction (tap delays, safe areas)
- Dark mode & theming
- Locale & i18n
- Hydration safety
- Common anti-patterns to flag

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:

1. Read the guidelines from `references/guideline.md`
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the guidelines
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.

## Output Format

Follow the format in the guidelines:

- Group findings by file
- Use `file:line` format (VS Code clickable)
- Terse, high signal-to-noise
- State issue + location
- Skip explanation unless fix is non-obvious
